This project has many features which are generally not available in normal library management system like facility of admin login   through which the admin can monitor the whole system. The Admin after logging into his account can perform various operations such as adding information of new student, new faculties, new books, issue books, return book details, deleting books, deleting student details  and so on.

And also Admin can delete the student details and book details. Students can borrow books from the library, and students can return their books before the due date. The time for returning the books is 7 days, if return date is exceeds then it calculates the fine per day 2Rs automatically. 

The Library Management System software allows to Student to borrow only 3 books, if student borrowed more than 3books,the system shows message ie;(This Student_id has taken 3 books, Try to return the books and borrow another one).
